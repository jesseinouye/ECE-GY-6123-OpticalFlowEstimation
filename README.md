# ECE-GY-6123-OpticalFlowEstimation

## Overview

This repo contains the final project of Dehit Trivedi and Jesse Inouye for ECE-6123 Image and Video Processing and NYU.

The overarching goal of the project was to compare different methods of optical flow estimation, and the code is split into two parts:
1. Iterative algorithms (e.g. Lucas-Kanade)
2. PWC-Net

## Iterative algorithms
